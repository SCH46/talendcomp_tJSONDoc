# Talend Component Suite tJSONDoc*
This project consists of components to work with JSON in a fine grained way.
* tJSONDocOpen - creates or opens a JSON document
* tJSONDocOutput - create sub-nodes to the document
* tJSONDocInput - select nodes vias json-path and read attributes from them
* tJSONDocExtractFields - similiar to tJSONDocInput but can work within a flow and do not have to start the flow
* tJSONDocInputStream - reads a large JSON file and use the streaming API to extract values or objects
* tJSONDocSave - write the JSON document as file or provide the content as flow
* tJSONDocDiff - compares 2 JSON documents and returns a detailed list of the differences
* tJSONDocMerge - merges 2 JSON documents by the help of key attributes
* tJSONDocTraverseFields - returns all key value pair for simple attributes, retrieves through the whole object and array hierachy

These components will be published on Talend Exchange: http://exchange.talend.com
